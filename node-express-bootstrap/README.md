# Building a Website from Scratch with ExpressJS and Bootstrap

ExpressJS is one of the most popular and widely used web frameworks used with Node.js. ExpressJS allows you to handle Routes, Server and I/O stuff very easily.

I developed a website using Bootstrap and ExpressJS. Express will work as the web server and routing handler, whereas Bootstrap and basic HTML for the view.

After checking out the project, open a command window then switch to the folder 'node-express-bootstrap'. Run 'npm install', this will install the dependency we require, which is express.
